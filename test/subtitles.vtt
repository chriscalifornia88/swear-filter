WEBVTT

2
00:02:11.884 --> 00:02:13.844
Come on. Y** gotta eat something.

3
00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:16.648
Eat one of those, and then y** don't

4
00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:18.454
Or the rest of week.

5
00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:22.374
Any luck, our girl Kat will

6
00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:24.876
Y** need some energy.

7
00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:26.295
Never know.

8
00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:27.900
Holder,

9
00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:31.904
I can't find the second shell casing.

1
00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:34.990
- Y** put them both on the table, right?

1
00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:38.494
It's gotta be in the house.

1
00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:40.559
Y** looked, right?

1
00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.289
Everywhere.

1
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.708
What about the gun?

1
00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:47.294
I got rid of it, like y**

1
00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:48.921
So it's there. Don't worry about it.

1
00:02:49.004 --> 00:02:51.382
- Come on. Eat something.

1
00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:54.218
Someone could find his car in that

1
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:55.970
I did.

2
00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:59.765
It didn't.

2
00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:03.690
The last thing he wanted was for

2
00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:07.239
How could I not have known who he was?

2
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.277
I don't know if I can do this.

2
00:03:14.905 --> 00:03:16.740
Y** have to.

2
00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.160
- We got no choice.

2
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.558
I could, um,

2
00:03:21.578 --> 00:03:25.249
just tell them who he was. What he was.

2
00:03:25.332 --> 00:03:26.792
Are y** fucking crazy?

2
00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.315
After everything we've gone through?

3
00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:31.463
Look, I'm not going to

3
00:03:38.887 --> 00:03:40.932
Caroline's pregnant.

3
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.708
Everything is different now.

3
00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:47.521
I'm gonna be a dad.

3
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.486
Gonna have a wife and baby that need me.

3
00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:01.827
So here's what we're gonna do, Linden.

3
00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:06.874
We're gonna move forward

3
00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.961
So eat y**r fucking muffin.

3
00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.672
We got a funeral to get to.

3
00:04:37.363 --> 00:04:39.365
Right, left.

4
00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:41.283
Right, left.

4
00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:43.410
Right, left.

4
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.664
Left, right.

4
00:04:46.747 --> 00:04:48.624
Left, right.

4
00:04:48.707 --> 00:04:51.377
What makes y** think Kat will show?

4
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.837
She was at the hospital.

4
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:57.800
Maybe she's his shorty.

4
00:04:59.593 --> 00:05:00.991
Then again, probably not.

4
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:02.680
That kid's never got his cherry popped.

4
00:05:02.763 --> 00:05:06.600
Left, right. Hold.

5
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:11.192
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

5
00:05:11.522 --> 00:05:14.483
Left round.

5
00:05:22.574 --> 00:05:24.535
Lower.

5
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.309
About face.

5
00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:32.960
Kyle.

5
00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:40.134
What do y** want?

5
00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:42.836
Sorry, Kyle, but we're

5
00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:46.245
Well, she's not here, okay?

5
00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.350
What the fuck?

5
00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:51.350
Why are y** wasting

6
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.440
instead of catching who

6
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.800
This is absolutely not the time.

6
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.528
Please.

6
00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:08.078
Told y** that girl wouldn't be here.

6
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.581
Really?

6
00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:17.151
He's a weak-willed son of a bitch.

6
00:06:17.171 --> 00:06:19.256
And I could give a shit

6
00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:21.454
Yeah. Yeah. I hear y**.

6
00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:23.240
I just wanna know where

6
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.451
- and I'll be out of y**r hair.

7
00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:28.557
Don't y** people ever

7
00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:32.124
I told that other detective that night

7
00:06:32.144 --> 00:06:33.599
What lake house?

7
00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:37.644
The crappy cabin we bought up at

7
00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:39.943
Didn't even have a toilet.

7
00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:43.218
We were y**ng then and stupid.

7
00:06:43.238 --> 00:06:45.205
Which detective did y** talk to?

7
00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:49.870
I don't know. The greasy

7
00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:52.790
He came to the house looking for James.

7
00:06:53.962 --> 00:06:56.877
- Thanks, Jen.

8
00:07:07.763 --> 00:07:09.890
Y**'ve reached the voice

8
00:07:09.974 --> 00:07:11.475
Uh, Lieutenant.

8
00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:12.559
Reddick here.

8
00:07:12.643 --> 00:07:15.646
Uh, sir, I know y**'re on vacation,

8
00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.295
but, uh, if y** could give me a

8
00:07:18.315 --> 00:07:22.883
Uh, not an emergency, but y**r

8
00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:25.844
Might wanna give her a call too.

8
00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:27.960
Uh, okay.

8
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.045
This is Detective Holder.

8
00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:42.172
Leave a message, I'll get back to y**.

9
00:07:47.303 --> 00:07:51.890
There is comfort in remembering

9
00:07:52.182 --> 00:07:56.020
There is comfort in knowing that

9
00:07:56.478 --> 00:08:01.942
And that Philip, Linda,

9
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.530
have finally come home.

9
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.199
Would y** like to say a few words, son?

9
00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:27.468
My family was, um,

9
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.596
a big part of my life.

9
00:08:31.657 --> 00:08:36.727
My little sister, Nadine, was funny, and

9
00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:38.865
and sweet and, uh...

9
00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:47.738
I guess some people think I did it.

1
00:08:56.965 --> 00:08:59.204
Thank y**, Kyle.

1
00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:08.467
Would y** please join me in prayer.

1
00:09:13.263 --> 00:09:15.746
Our Father who art in heaven,

1
00:09:15.766 --> 00:09:17.998
hallowed be thy name,

1
00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:20.030
thy kingdom come,

1
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.760
thy will be done on

1
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.362
Give us this day our daily bread

1
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:55.514
I shouldn't have said that.

1
00:09:56.339 --> 00:09:58.976
I should've written something to say.

1
00:10:03.205 --> 00:10:06.959
People think they know what grief is,

1
00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:08.669
they don't.

1
00:10:10.838 --> 00:10:14.258
Y** say things and do things sometimes

1
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:16.593
that don't make sense.

1
00:10:19.972 --> 00:10:22.099
Y** did fine, Kyle.

1
00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:34.004
Cadet Knopf, y** needed to see me?

1
00:11:34.088 --> 00:11:35.923
Yes, ma'am.

1
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.052
- May I speak freely, ma'am?

1
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:44.139
What is it, Knopf?

1
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:46.892
This is difficult because I know

1
00:11:46.975 --> 00:11:47.976
for Cadet Stansbury.

1
00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:50.729
If this is a private discussion,

1
00:11:50.749 --> 00:11:52.564
But rules are rules.

1
00:11:52.648 --> 00:11:55.818
And as duty guard, I'm aware

1
00:11:55.838 --> 00:11:58.028
"Good order is the

1
00:11:58.048 --> 00:12:01.365
What do y** want, Lincoln?

1
00:12:01.615 --> 00:12:04.576
Last night, while I was on

1
00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:08.470
I witnessed a y**ng woman sneaking

1
00:12:09.164 --> 00:12:10.332
How old was she?

1
00:12:10.352 --> 00:12:12.209
I'd say 25-ish.

1
00:12:13.043 --> 00:12:14.461
Who is she?

1
00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:16.588
I have no idea, ma'am.

1
00:12:17.343 --> 00:12:20.134
But I did hear what

1
00:12:23.498 --> 00:12:25.264
See this car here?

1
00:12:25.347 --> 00:12:26.807
Here it is again.

1
00:12:26.827 --> 00:12:28.767
Yeah. Looks like a Toyota.

1
00:12:29.184 --> 00:12:32.271
It's a Corolla maybe.

1
00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:34.732
These photos were taken

1
00:12:34.752 --> 00:12:37.423
This car was parked in front

1
00:12:37.443 --> 00:12:38.966
early morning, late at night.

1
00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:41.489
Here, there's somebody

1
00:12:41.947 --> 00:12:44.566
I wanna know who this car belongs to.

1
00:12:44.908 --> 00:12:46.326
Sarah, it's the needle in a haystack.

1
00:12:46.346 --> 00:12:49.143
I mean, we got a make, maybe.

1
00:12:49.163 --> 00:12:51.729
This isn't much of a license plate.

1
00:12:51.749 --> 00:12:53.522
This doesn't give us a lot to work with.

1
00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:56.962
So canvass the neighborhood.

1
00:12:57.045 --> 00:12:59.214
- Just do it.

1
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.620
Thanks, Harjo.

1
00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:10.893
Is there something I could

1
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.729
Looks like y** just moved in.

1
00:13:14.287 --> 00:13:15.711
Been a few years, actually.

1
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:17.608
Decor is not our first priority.

1
00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:19.359
Evidently.

1
00:13:19.443 --> 00:13:21.216
How many of y** are there?

1
00:13:21.236 --> 00:13:23.350
- Homicide detectives?

1
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:25.449
Y**'re looking at her.

1
00:13:25.908 --> 00:13:29.453
There are advantages to being

1
00:13:29.536 --> 00:13:32.352
I don't know. I've never

1
00:13:32.372 --> 00:13:35.084
We can be challenging.

1
00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:37.082
Or so I've been told.

1
00:13:40.923 --> 00:13:43.550
Yeah. How can I help y**, Colonel?

1
00:13:45.761 --> 00:13:49.890
I think I may know where y** can find

1
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.850
Kat something or other?

1
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.290
Did Kyle say something about her?

1
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.252
No, but she apparently

1
00:13:57.272 --> 00:13:59.380
That's strictly against school rules.

1
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.569
And Kyle knows that.

1
00:14:03.779 --> 00:14:06.031
I am doing everything that

1
00:14:06.051 --> 00:14:07.741
As I told y** that I would.

1
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.160
Did y** see the girl?

1
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.857
One of my boys did.

1
00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:15.207
He heard her invite

1
00:14:15.227 --> 00:14:17.665
She's some kind of musician.

1
00:14:25.217 --> 00:14:26.802
Yo, Holder.

1
00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:29.012
- Y** got a sec?

1
00:14:29.032 --> 00:14:32.307
I gotta pick something up for Caroline,

1
00:14:32.327 --> 00:14:36.311
Look at y**. All

1
00:14:37.016 --> 00:14:39.670
- Keeps me off the streets.

1
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.817
I know y** told me, but

1
00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:47.239
What did y** say y** were doing that

1
00:14:47.948 --> 00:14:50.649
Same as y**. I was looking for the kid.

1
00:14:50.669 --> 00:14:51.348
Yeah.

1
00:14:51.368 --> 00:14:54.435
Y** didn't tell me y** were at

1
00:14:54.747 --> 00:14:57.178
What lake house? Why would I do that?

1
00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.126
Yeah, right.

1
00:14:59.486 --> 00:15:01.920
Having a senior moment, I guess.

1
00:15:02.004 --> 00:15:04.903
What's with all the questions, man? Y**

1
00:15:04.923 --> 00:15:06.572
Just dotting my T's, crossing my I's.

1
00:15:06.592 --> 00:15:08.907
Pulling all this Pied Piper

1
00:15:08.927 --> 00:15:10.367
Yeah, y** worry me, bro.

1
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:13.015
Seem a little scattered.

1
00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:17.661
Maybe y** ought to try some of

1
00:15:31.575 --> 00:15:33.869
We got a lead on the girl.

1
00:15:49.606 --> 00:15:51.929
ESD said Kat's last place of employment

1
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:54.036
was Greenhurst Equestrian Center.

1
00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:56.308
The Stansburys were members.

1
00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.769
Maybe the dad gave her a job.

1
00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:01.008
Why would he do that?

1
00:16:01.827 --> 00:16:04.441
He liked her torn fishnets.

1
00:16:05.609 --> 00:16:07.888
Tell y** one thing, Kat

2
00:16:07.908 --> 00:16:09.873
if she plays at a joint like that.

2
00:16:13.492 --> 00:16:14.807
What is that?

2
00:16:14.827 --> 00:16:17.371
Chipotle cheese kale chips.

2
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.668
Y**'re gonna feed that

2
00:16:23.335 --> 00:16:25.045
Maybe.

2
00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:27.089
When he has teeth.

2
00:16:27.172 --> 00:16:30.300
He? What makes y** think it's a he?

2
00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:34.012
I don't know. I guess I always figured

2
00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:36.223
I'd have a little man, y** know.

2
00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:40.853
So y**'re just going for

2
00:16:40.983 --> 00:16:45.128
I'm going to my first

2
00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:48.736
I just never saw y**

2
00:16:48.819 --> 00:16:50.112
What can I say, Linden?

2
00:16:50.195 --> 00:16:52.785
Y**'ve been an inspiration to me.

2
00:16:56.326 --> 00:16:58.495
Y**'ll be a good dad.

2
00:16:59.527 --> 00:17:02.332
What did Reddick want earlier?

2
00:17:02.916 --> 00:17:06.420
Nothing. Just talking

2
00:17:13.802 --> 00:17:15.387
That's her, right?

2
00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:18.515
Yep.

2
00:17:23.437 --> 00:17:25.242
Whoa, there, kitty, kitty, kitty.

2
00:17:25.262 --> 00:17:28.233
- Where y** going? Y** just got here.

2
00:17:29.234 --> 00:17:31.070
Seattle Police.

2
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.760
Y** got a minute?

2
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.698
Let's go, kitty.

2
00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:39.495
Y** were arrested for assaulting

2
00:17:39.515 --> 00:17:42.414
- He dropped the charges.

2
00:17:42.915 --> 00:17:45.918
- Was he y**r sugar daddy?

2
00:17:45.938 --> 00:17:48.754
I needed the money and

2
00:17:48.774 --> 00:17:51.548
That beach house, y** were living there?

2
00:17:51.945 --> 00:17:53.675
I don't buy it, mamacita.

2
00:17:53.695 --> 00:17:56.678
Why would he move a sneaky little

2
00:17:56.698 --> 00:17:59.036
unless he was getting a little

2
00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.925
How the hell should I know?

2
00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:04.395
Guess he was just a nice guy.

2
00:18:04.686 --> 00:18:06.522
- Can I go now?

2
00:18:07.022 --> 00:18:08.816
A nice guy?

2
00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:11.090
Ask his kid.

2
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.569
We're asking y**.

2
00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:20.202
He was okay.

2
00:18:20.285 --> 00:18:24.331
He got me a job shoveling horse

2
00:18:24.351 --> 00:18:27.022
so I guess I should

2
00:18:27.042 --> 00:18:29.650
Seems y** had a pretty good

2
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:30.901
Why'd y** leave?

2
00:18:30.921 --> 00:18:32.986
Because the social experiment was over.

2
00:18:33.006 --> 00:18:34.508
And he had failed.

2
00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:36.009
Who?

2
00:18:36.719 --> 00:18:42.376
Philip Stansbury, a.k.a.

2
00:18:42.396 --> 00:18:45.836
failed to rehabilitate

2
00:18:46.353 --> 00:18:48.502
That was his mantra.

2
00:18:48.522 --> 00:18:53.026
Hard work and discipline will

2
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.320
Apparently, a shit-ton of money.

2
00:18:55.404 --> 00:18:57.303
- Y** seen that house?

2
00:18:57.323 --> 00:18:59.888
We've got y**r prints all over it.

2
00:18:59.908 --> 00:19:03.078
I used to sneak in when

2
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:07.958
Walk, pretend I lived in those

2
00:19:07.978 --> 00:19:09.251
But it wasn't.

2
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.045
I was just an example to his loser son

2
00:19:12.065 --> 00:19:16.321
that following the rules could

2
00:19:16.341 --> 00:19:18.365
Do y**r chores. Clean y**r room.

2
00:19:18.385 --> 00:19:19.553
No blue jeans.

2
00:19:19.573 --> 00:19:21.702
No posters on the walls.

2
00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:23.932
No snacking between meals.

2
00:19:23.952 --> 00:19:26.143
What rules did y** break?

2
00:19:26.894 --> 00:19:30.210
Took a fucking

2
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.063
because I was hungry.

2
00:19:35.152 --> 00:19:37.514
He practically called the cops.

2
00:19:38.072 --> 00:19:41.696
When Kyle tried to stand up for

2
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:46.622
His own kid.

2
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.269
So y** had plenty of motive

2
00:19:58.634 --> 00:20:01.617
A lot of people hated the Stansburys.

2
00:20:01.637 --> 00:20:04.119
They were mean, hateful people.

2
00:20:04.139 --> 00:20:08.602
Their stuck-up daughter was cruel.

2
00:20:08.622 --> 00:20:13.065
Used to walk around the house braless,

2
00:20:13.857 --> 00:20:17.861
I heard rumors she used to teach

2
00:20:17.881 --> 00:20:20.197
and then something happened.

2
00:20:21.736 --> 00:20:22.950
Poor Kyle.

2
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:27.329
The only thing he ever did was

2
00:20:27.913 --> 00:20:30.582
I was the only friend he had.

2
00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:34.233
That motherfucker being dead

2
00:20:34.253 --> 00:20:37.569
is the best thing that

2
00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:39.307
Trust me.

2
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.303
Y** were there that night.

2
00:20:43.323 --> 00:20:45.889
The lights were on in the beach house.

2
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.834
Kyle gave me the key, okay? It was

2
00:20:51.854 --> 00:20:53.480
That night?

2
00:20:58.485 --> 00:21:00.771
Fell asleep watching TV.

2
00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:05.409
I heard this noise...

2
00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:08.620
like a scream.

2
00:21:09.026 --> 00:21:10.978
Freaked me out.

2
00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:13.333
I was going over to the house...

2
00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:16.378
and then I heard gunshots.

2
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:20.507
Lots and lots of gunshots.

2
00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:23.886
I got scared and ran.

2
00:21:24.553 --> 00:21:26.388
Can I please go now?

2
00:21:26.408 --> 00:21:30.229
Afraid not. We're gonna need y**r

2
00:21:32.978 --> 00:21:35.169
Then I want a lawyer.

2
00:21:50.746 --> 00:21:53.040
Dead center's 10 points.

2
00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.125
If any of the dot

2
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.440
Shooting's a very mental sport.

2
00:22:07.846 --> 00:22:11.225
If y**'re not prepared

3
00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:13.495
Meyers says he thinks

3
00:22:13.515 --> 00:22:15.990
at qualifying for Junior Olympics.

3
00:22:17.007 --> 00:22:18.899
If Rayne will let me.

3
00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:21.380
That bitch wants to do

3
00:22:22.778 --> 00:22:25.406
My dad will have something

3
00:22:25.426 --> 00:22:26.654
I thought y** liked her.

3
00:22:26.674 --> 00:22:28.450
It's not about liking.

3
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.027
It's about what she's

3
00:22:30.047 --> 00:22:33.163
Y** know, graduating from this

3
00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:37.751
The whole place has gone to shit.

3
00:22:38.585 --> 00:22:41.213
Now they'll let anyone

3
00:22:42.047 --> 00:22:45.884
Well, Colonel Rayne seems to

3
00:22:45.904 --> 00:22:47.221
No shit she does.

3
00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:49.505
It's the only job she could get

3
00:22:49.525 --> 00:22:51.984
I heard she was dishonorably discharged.

3
00:22:52.307 --> 00:22:54.101
Y** heard from whom?

3
00:22:54.184 --> 00:22:56.117
My dad knows a lot of people.

3
00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.437
Y** want a shot?

3
00:22:58.673 --> 00:23:00.462
Heh. No, that's okay.

3
00:23:00.482 --> 00:23:03.110
I'm not very good.

3
00:23:03.193 --> 00:23:05.732
Y**'re probably better

3
00:23:11.887 --> 00:23:13.032
Uh-oh.

3
00:23:13.052 --> 00:23:15.240
Here comes Ginger.

3
00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:30.262
Get out of the car.

3
00:23:39.688 --> 00:23:41.106
Get out. Now.

3
00:23:43.776 --> 00:23:45.758
I'm through with y**r bullshit.

3
00:23:45.778 --> 00:23:47.678
Get out.

3
00:23:53.744 --> 00:23:55.601
- Stop. Stop.

3
00:23:55.621 --> 00:23:57.186
Y**r parents were asleep.

3
00:23:57.206 --> 00:23:59.107
The killer was cold-blooded,

3
00:23:59.127 --> 00:24:00.208
- Please stop.

3
00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:01.627
- Just stop.

3
00:24:01.647 --> 00:24:02.775
He never had a chance.

3
00:24:02.795 --> 00:24:05.297
Shot in the chest three

3
00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.820
Blew a hole right through his head.

3
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.781
Why are y** doing this to me?

3
00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:10.223
- And then y**r mom.

3
00:24:10.243 --> 00:24:12.846
She was wounded, but

3
00:24:12.866 --> 00:24:14.431
- Shot three times in the back.

3
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:15.954
Once in the back of the head.

3
00:24:15.974 --> 00:24:17.331
- Was she screaming?

3
00:24:17.351 --> 00:24:20.000
- Did she call out for y**, Kyle?

3
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.188
I don't remember.

3
00:24:21.208 --> 00:24:24.024
- Was Kat here? Was she with y**?

3
00:24:24.044 --> 00:24:25.172
She was y**r only friend.

3
00:24:25.192 --> 00:24:28.153
She said y**r father being dead was the

3
00:24:28.173 --> 00:24:30.656
- I don't know why she said that, I swear.

3
00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:32.763
- Leave me alone.

3
00:24:32.783 --> 00:24:34.390
Did she do this to make

3
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:36.809
- No. No.

3
00:24:36.829 --> 00:24:39.186
No. No. She didn't help me do it.

3
00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.355
Y** lied about knowing Kat.

3
00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:43.288
What else did y** lie about?

3
00:24:43.585 --> 00:24:44.942
Did y** pull the trigger?

3
00:24:44.962 --> 00:24:47.423
Stop it. I'm gonna be sick.

3
00:25:01.562 --> 00:25:04.578
Come on. We're not done.

3
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.070
Don't. Not anymore. Please.

3
00:25:11.905 --> 00:25:14.575
That is where we found Nadine.

3
00:25:18.162 --> 00:25:20.080
Who could kill a sweet,

3
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.498
I don't know.

3
00:25:21.518 --> 00:25:24.835
I don't know. I would tell y** if I did.

3
00:25:25.878 --> 00:25:29.194
She was the only one who loved me.

3
00:25:29.214 --> 00:25:34.228
She was the only one who cared about

3
00:25:53.447 --> 00:25:56.408
There was no music in this house.

3
00:25:57.326 --> 00:25:59.018
No talking.

3
00:25:59.038 --> 00:26:01.185
They all hated me.

3
00:26:01.205 --> 00:26:03.165
Why did they hate y**?

3
00:26:03.582 --> 00:26:05.167
This...

3
00:26:05.187 --> 00:26:08.212
I don't know.

3
00:26:08.232 --> 00:26:11.674
No one told the truth about anything.

3
00:26:15.971 --> 00:26:18.410
What was the truth, Kyle?

3
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:20.099
I don't know.

3
00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:27.940
Did I kill them?

3
00:26:28.399 --> 00:26:30.776
Maybe I did.

3
00:26:31.151 --> 00:26:34.613
Y** loved Nadine. Do y** really

3
00:26:38.784 --> 00:26:40.202
No.

3
00:26:41.954 --> 00:26:43.539
Never.

3
00:27:19.324 --> 00:27:22.266
From the moment I was born, that's

3
00:27:22.286 --> 00:27:25.789
- What?

3
00:27:26.373 --> 00:27:29.322
- Y** collect those?

3
00:27:29.626 --> 00:27:31.920
My dad gave me one every

3
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.360
But I wasn't allowed to touch them.

3
00:27:35.382 --> 00:27:36.967
They're rare.

3
00:27:37.801 --> 00:27:40.260
Kat mentioned something about

3
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.593
at the high school with y**r mom.

3
00:27:42.853 --> 00:27:45.017
Y** know what she was talking about?

3
00:28:10.292 --> 00:28:11.919
Y** sure?

3
00:28:12.377 --> 00:28:14.818
The girl's prints don't

3
00:28:14.838 --> 00:28:16.528
Partial on the gun?

3
00:28:16.548 --> 00:28:19.134
All right. Well, just run it again.

3
00:28:20.052 --> 00:28:21.241
Just do it, all right?

3
00:28:21.261 --> 00:28:23.305
Call me back when it's done.

3
00:28:25.974 --> 00:28:27.706
I must've messed up the time.

3
00:28:27.726 --> 00:28:29.728
Sorry, babe.

3
00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:33.065
I got there, they said y**

3
00:28:33.148 --> 00:28:36.235
Well, I found out our due date.

3
00:28:36.568 --> 00:28:38.059
October 10th.

3
00:28:38.654 --> 00:28:40.614
The baby's a Libra.

3
00:28:40.697 --> 00:28:42.825
That's tight, right?

3
00:28:42.908 --> 00:28:45.411
- That's a good thing?

4
00:28:45.494 --> 00:28:50.749
I think the Libras are diplomatic

4
00:28:52.418 --> 00:28:54.216
What's going on?

4
00:28:55.129 --> 00:28:58.298
We're holding someone for

4
00:28:58.882 --> 00:29:00.551
I don't think she did it.

4
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:03.262
No, I meant, what's wrong?

4
00:29:03.345 --> 00:29:05.889
Y**'ve been kind of out of it.

4
00:29:05.973 --> 00:29:07.558
Nothing.

4
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.101
Y** do remember that we're having dinner

4
00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:14.898
with y**r sister and her

4
00:29:14.982 --> 00:29:17.776
Because clearly,

4
00:29:21.864 --> 00:29:26.410
I'm sorry, babe. I've just been

4
00:29:28.412 --> 00:29:31.220
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

4
00:29:31.828 --> 00:29:33.792
Uh, nothing.

4
00:29:34.042 --> 00:29:35.816
Just don't forget the dinner.

4
00:29:35.836 --> 00:29:38.566
Okay? That's the big deal.

4
00:29:38.889 --> 00:29:40.466
Mm-hm.

4
00:31:37.207 --> 00:31:39.752
- Jack.

4
00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:43.318
Oh, no. It's spring break.

4
00:31:43.338 --> 00:31:46.008
I was supposed to pick y**

4
00:31:46.028 --> 00:31:48.612
I tried to call y**,

4
00:31:48.632 --> 00:31:51.436
So I took a cab.

4
00:31:51.638 --> 00:31:53.432
I'm sorry.

4
00:31:54.016 --> 00:31:57.019
I'm sorry. I'm so glad y**'re here.

4
00:31:58.228 --> 00:32:00.022
Are y** okay, Mom?

4
00:32:01.087 --> 00:32:03.025
Yeah, I am now.

4
00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:05.277
I am now.

4
00:32:08.614 --> 00:32:11.325
There he was, standing at my door.

4
00:32:11.345 --> 00:32:14.203
I didn't even remember he was coming.

4
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.872
Of course,

4
00:32:16.955 --> 00:32:19.291
so I guess he'll just hang

4
00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:22.503
He'll be all right as

4
00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:25.380
Y**'re full of sunshine today.

4
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.009
I've been thinking about Kat.

4
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:30.407
It doesn't feel right.

4
00:32:30.427 --> 00:32:32.242
Ain't her palm print on the gun.

4
00:32:32.262 --> 00:32:33.994
We should probably cut her loose.

4
00:32:34.014 --> 00:32:37.729
And I don't think Kyle did it

4
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:41.522
Look, I've been thinking.

4
00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:47.653
I mean, Reddick ain't as much

4
00:32:48.946 --> 00:32:51.678
Yesterday, he asked me what

4
00:32:51.698 --> 00:32:53.317
What'd y** tell him?

4
00:32:53.784 --> 00:32:56.225
I told him I was looking

4
00:32:56.245 --> 00:32:57.935
So, what's the problem?

4
00:32:57.955 --> 00:33:00.477
He brought up the lake house.

4
00:33:01.125 --> 00:33:03.482
I mean, I played dumb,

4
00:33:03.502 --> 00:33:05.401
He ain't letting it go.

4
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:07.945
He must have talked to Jen.

4
00:33:07.965 --> 00:33:10.646
Y** asked her about the

4
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:14.054
What are we gonna do?

4
00:33:15.091 --> 00:33:17.496
She doesn't know anything, and

4
00:33:17.516 --> 00:33:19.248
He's just digging.

4
00:33:19.518 --> 00:33:21.709
Why didn't y** tell me about this?

4
00:33:21.729 --> 00:33:23.647
I just did.

4
00:33:23.981 --> 00:33:25.504
We can't afford to keep secrets.

4
00:33:25.524 --> 00:33:28.112
Just keep y**r shit together, Holder.

4
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.076
Yes, Linda Stansbury was assistant coach

4
00:33:36.096 --> 00:33:39.121
for our boys' varsity tennis

4
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:41.540
She was quite a dynamo.

4
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.898
What a tragedy. That poor family.

4
00:33:44.918 --> 00:33:47.304
We heard she had some

4
00:33:47.463 --> 00:33:49.278
It was hearsay.

4
00:33:49.298 --> 00:33:51.530
And I prefer not to

4
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.010
Aw.

4
00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:54.787
Go ahead.

4
00:33:55.179 --> 00:33:56.702
Was she fired?

4
00:33:56.722 --> 00:34:00.330
We came to an agreement that it might

4
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.124
So she was fired. Why?

4
00:34:02.144 --> 00:34:04.710
I don't really think we need

4
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.207
This is a multiple homicide

4
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.277
So y** can make it easy on y**rself,

4
00:34:10.297 --> 00:34:14.548
or we can bring y** down to Homicide for

4
00:34:16.617 --> 00:34:19.536
There were allegations of

4
00:34:19.556 --> 00:34:21.027
with a 16-year-old

4
00:34:21.047 --> 00:34:23.499
- Male or female?

4
00:34:23.582 --> 00:34:25.614
One of her tennis players.

4
00:34:27.002 --> 00:34:32.716
There were, um, suggestive texts sent,

4
00:34:32.736 --> 00:34:35.282
- But no charges were filed?

4
00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:37.971
Whoa. So y** had a teacher

4
00:34:37.991 --> 00:34:39.620
and y** didn't file charges?

4
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.748
His parents weren't interested

4
00:34:42.768 --> 00:34:44.750
And Mrs. Stansbury left.

4
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.593
She was a volunteer, y** see.

4
00:34:48.613 --> 00:34:52.216
I'm sure the Stansburys donated

4
00:34:52.236 --> 00:34:55.177
Explains why nobody believed

4
00:34:55.197 --> 00:34:57.596
He was extremely troubled.

4
00:34:57.616 --> 00:34:59.535
Shortly after Mrs. Stansbury left,

4
00:34:59.555 --> 00:35:02.913
he came to school with

4
00:35:03.497 --> 00:35:04.603
What kind of weapon?

4
00:35:04.623 --> 00:35:08.065
We have a strict zero-tolerance

4
00:35:08.085 --> 00:35:10.254
so he had to leave, of course.

4
00:35:10.337 --> 00:35:13.674
Like I said, he was a very troubled boy.

4
00:35:14.468 --> 00:35:16.468
What's his name, Mr. Duvergne?

4
00:35:16.488 --> 00:35:19.555
I'm sorry, but I really

4
00:35:19.638 --> 00:35:21.724
He was a minor, that's

4
00:35:21.744 --> 00:35:24.417
I'm within my rights

4
00:35:24.437 --> 00:35:28.314
Now, if y**'ll excuse me, I

4
00:35:30.347 --> 00:35:33.152
What kind of weapon

4
00:35:35.795 --> 00:35:37.386
A handgun.

4
00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:40.051
With 50 rounds of ammunition.

4
00:35:43.704 --> 00:35:46.081
I'll call King County Sheriff's,

5
00:35:46.101 --> 00:35:49.835
of a kid with a gun at Meadow

5
00:35:49.918 --> 00:35:51.253
Hey, Sarah.

5
00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:53.338
Hey, I canvassed the entire

5
00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:56.383
There's no older model Corollas for

5
00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:57.698
What about partial plates?

5
00:35:57.718 --> 00:35:59.887
We got three letters: W, E and Q.

5
00:35:59.907 --> 00:36:01.930
And over 5000 hits.

5
00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:03.996
- Okay. Thanks, Harjo.

5
00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:06.305
Holder, Linden, got a second?

5
00:36:12.983 --> 00:36:14.443
What's up?

5
00:36:16.278 --> 00:36:19.073
Y** two know Bethany Skinner, right?

5
00:36:23.118 --> 00:36:25.579
I thought y**'d wanna

5
00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.247
Yeah? What about him?

5
00:36:28.332 --> 00:36:29.855
He's alive and well.

5
00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:32.576
Clearing his head in Wyoming

5
00:36:33.212 --> 00:36:36.632
Dad texted me this morning. Finally.

5
00:36:37.591 --> 00:36:40.177
Sorry, I guess I overreacted.

5
00:36:43.514 --> 00:36:46.100
Guess we can call off the dogs, hm?

5
00:37:07.788 --> 00:37:09.581
What the hell's going on?

5
00:37:09.665 --> 00:37:12.209
Am I going fucking nuts here?

5
00:37:14.962 --> 00:37:17.736
Y** sent that text. Y** kept his phone?

5
00:37:17.756 --> 00:37:20.114
Yeah. Thank God I did. It saved us.

5
00:37:20.134 --> 00:37:23.325
- I got her and him off our backs.

5
00:37:23.345 --> 00:37:25.806
- What else y** got?

5
00:37:26.306 --> 00:37:28.308
Y** didn't think to tell

5
00:37:28.328 --> 00:37:30.978
- No, I didn't.

5
00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:33.522
Y** were losing y**r shit, Holder.

5
00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:37.317
Me? Y**'re the crazy one. Y**'re the

5
00:37:37.337 --> 00:37:41.311
Look, just calm down.

5
00:37:42.573 --> 00:37:45.701
We don't have to worry about Bethany

5
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.828
We got away with it.

5
00:37:48.787 --> 00:37:50.914
Isn't that what y** wanted?

5
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.459
That's enough for today, cadet.

5
00:38:36.085 --> 00:38:38.378
Hopefully, y**'ve learned y**r lesson.

5
00:38:38.462 --> 00:38:39.610
Y**'re dismissed.

5
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.341
Y** may return to the

5
00:38:42.591 --> 00:38:46.720
Ma'am, I'd like to stay and

5
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.390
When everyone goes home for the weekend,

5
00:38:53.227 --> 00:38:54.812
All right, then.

5
00:38:57.064 --> 00:39:01.640
Why don't y** get cleaned up and

5
00:39:03.487 --> 00:39:05.438
I imagine y**'re hungry.

5
00:39:24.258 --> 00:39:27.428
Y** said in y**r, um...

5
00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:31.473
that y** were interested

5
00:39:31.493 --> 00:39:33.615
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

5
00:39:35.204 --> 00:39:37.354
Y** have time to figure it out.

5
00:39:38.269 --> 00:39:40.172
I'm graduating in three months,

5
00:39:40.192 --> 00:39:43.777
so I think that ship has kind

5
00:39:45.028 --> 00:39:49.658
If y** could go somewhere,

5
00:39:49.742 --> 00:39:52.453
I just wanna get out of Seattle.

5
00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:54.945
I hate the rain.

5
00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:01.771
I'm sorry I lied to y**.

5
00:40:03.964 --> 00:40:07.114
Kat had nothing to do with it, and, um,

5
00:40:07.134 --> 00:40:08.844
I didn't want her to get in any trouble.

5
00:40:08.927 --> 00:40:12.820
She's had it tough enough as it is.

5
00:40:15.476 --> 00:40:17.895
I won't break the rules anymore.

5
00:40:29.694 --> 00:40:32.821
We can have dessert in the living room.

5
00:41:30.548 --> 00:41:33.452
Oh, don't stop. That was lovely.

5
00:41:34.888 --> 00:41:37.373
I don't remember the rest.

5
00:41:39.476 --> 00:41:43.627
Y**r father said y** were very

5
00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:45.893
I was never good enough.

5
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.026
My dad used to take me

5
00:41:48.046 --> 00:41:50.612
but he said it was a waste of time.

5
00:41:53.574 --> 00:41:56.076
I was never very musical.

5
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:59.747
But I'll tell y** a secret.

5
00:42:08.088 --> 00:42:09.840
I dance.

5
00:42:11.027 --> 00:42:12.715
Ballroom dancing.

5
00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.950
Really?

5
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:17.097
- Really.

5
00:42:24.014 --> 00:42:27.923
Y** know, I was raised

5
00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.528
and I know what that's like.

5
00:42:32.112 --> 00:42:33.906
To want somebody's approval.

5
00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:36.700
To long for it and...

5
00:42:37.618 --> 00:42:39.828
to never quite get it.

5
00:42:44.893 --> 00:42:47.252
Kyle, did he hurt y**?

5
00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:49.963
Did he do that to y**?

5
00:42:51.673 --> 00:42:54.134
My dad? No.

5
00:42:55.177 --> 00:42:57.179
Uh, Nadine did.

5
00:42:57.262 --> 00:42:58.722
Y**r little sister?

5
00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:01.058
She had night terrors.

5
00:43:01.433 --> 00:43:04.061
She'd just be sitting

5
00:43:04.081 --> 00:43:06.271
like fully open, screaming, and...

5
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:08.232
But I couldn't wake her up.

5
00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:10.442
So I'd just hold her

5
00:43:10.462 --> 00:43:14.488
And she'd scratch and

5
00:43:15.406 --> 00:43:18.409
And I'd just wrap my arms around her.

5
00:43:19.774 --> 00:43:24.081
And I could just feel her little heart

5
00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:27.751
It was like that almost

5
00:43:27.921 --> 00:43:31.713
But what about y**r parents?

5
00:43:31.733 --> 00:43:36.343
Yeah. It went on for hours

5
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.871
She used to say there

5
00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:47.688
I told her not to be afraid, y**

5
00:43:58.949 --> 00:44:01.890
Y** know what y** said

5
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:03.829
How'd y** know?

5
00:44:05.372 --> 00:44:08.056
I lost someone, uh,

5
00:44:08.304 --> 00:44:11.545
very close to me once.

5
00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.675
I didn't realize at the

5
00:44:18.427 --> 00:44:21.970
But I grieve it every day.

5
00:44:26.435 --> 00:44:32.188
Kyle, I think that it is a good thing

5
00:44:33.192 --> 00:44:35.778
The discipline, the

5
00:44:35.798 --> 00:44:37.384
gave my life meaning again,

6
00:44:37.404 --> 00:44:39.990
and it can do the same for y**.

6
00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:43.118
Well, y** don't seem happy.

6
00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:47.998
I am.

6
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.292
I'm very happy.

6
00:44:57.716 --> 00:44:59.635
This cake's good.

6
00:45:41.593 --> 00:45:45.347
It's called a natural childbirth

6
00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:47.349
Women have been doing

6
00:45:47.369 --> 00:45:49.006
Maybe even longer.

6
00:45:50.372 --> 00:45:52.329
Why would we take her to a hospital?

6
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:54.022
They'll just shoot her

6
00:45:54.042 --> 00:45:55.983
All right, little man.

6
00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:57.517
We get it. We get it.

6
00:45:57.537 --> 00:45:59.383
And she won't even bond with the baby.

6
00:45:59.403 --> 00:46:03.115
Come on. I had both of these kids in the

6
00:46:03.135 --> 00:46:05.374
All I care about is a healthy baby.

6
00:46:05.871 --> 00:46:08.162
And I mean, it's safer at home.

6
00:46:08.182 --> 00:46:10.622
Y** know, birth is a sacred experience.

6
00:46:10.642 --> 00:46:14.042
Sage and myrrh massages

6
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.963
Heh. Okay. Wow. Heh, TMI, babe.

6
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.708
All right, little man, chill.

6
00:46:24.595 --> 00:46:27.139
Don't y** want a doctor there?

6
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:30.372
- What could go wrong?

6
00:46:30.517 --> 00:46:33.062
Can we not talk about this

6
00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:34.891
- Me.

6
00:46:36.157 --> 00:46:39.276
My friend Marny's baby got stuck.

6
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.446
Yeah, well, that ain't gonna happen.

6
00:46:42.529 --> 00:46:45.032
Y** know what y**r problem is, Liz?

6
00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:48.015
Y**'re a downer. Y** always have been.

6
00:46:48.035 --> 00:46:51.060
That's why y** can't get a date.

6
00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.707
All right, shut the fuck up, little man.

6
00:46:53.791 --> 00:46:55.230
Stephen.

6
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:59.526
He can take it. His dad used to say

6
00:46:59.546 --> 00:47:02.049
Huh? Ain't that right?

6
00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:06.678
- Shut the fuck up.

6
00:47:06.762 --> 00:47:10.015
Great. Great. Thanks a lot, Uncle Steve.

6
00:47:10.099 --> 00:47:12.476
I'm sorry,

6
00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.792
They don't listen to a thing y** say.

6
00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:16.085
Kids need boundaries.

6
00:47:16.105 --> 00:47:18.565
Yeah. Like y** know the first

6
00:47:18.585 --> 00:47:21.237
Y**'re barely out of

6
00:47:22.486 --> 00:47:23.779
I'm sorry, Caroline,

6
00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:28.784
but the idea of this guy being

6
00:47:30.035 --> 00:47:34.069
I forget. If y**'re clean in NA, does

6
00:47:34.206 --> 00:47:35.479
Fuck y** too.

6
00:47:35.499 --> 00:47:37.459
Sorry, kids.

6
00:47:37.543 --> 00:47:39.228
Stephen, come on. Please stop.

6
00:47:39.248 --> 00:47:42.381
He can't help himself,

6
00:47:42.464 --> 00:47:45.008
Whatever. Beyotch.

6
00:47:45.092 --> 00:47:47.603
Don't y** dare talk that

6
00:47:47.623 --> 00:47:51.161
He picked up a new case.

6
00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:54.685
Don't apologize for me. Y**

6
00:47:56.376 --> 00:47:58.063
Isn't this what y** want?

6
00:47:58.083 --> 00:48:01.275
Y**r little bro getting married,

6
00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:02.756
Well, I did it.

6
00:48:02.776 --> 00:48:05.863
I more than did it. We're gonna make it.

6
00:48:07.072 --> 00:48:09.164
I made it. Fuck, I more than made it.

6
00:48:09.184 --> 00:48:10.889
We're gonna be happy.

6
00:48:10.909 --> 00:48:13.954
Just because y**'ve never

6
00:48:14.537 --> 00:48:17.020
Even though Mark was an

6
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.511
Stephen.

6
00:48:19.835 --> 00:48:21.754
Kill myself too,

6
00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:23.723
Stephen, shut up.

6
00:48:24.548 --> 00:48:27.926
Who wants to watch cartoons?

6
00:48:33.196 --> 00:48:35.893
Y**'re an awful person.

6
00:48:37.728 --> 00:48:39.271
Maybe.

6
00:50:38.432 --> 00:50:42.295
I can't tell y** how many times

6
00:50:42.779 --> 00:50:44.752
Woke up to check the grill of my car

6
00:50:44.772 --> 00:50:48.645
to make sure there wasn't somebody's

6
00:50:48.918 --> 00:50:50.778
God was in that car

6
00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:53.720
He was behind the wheel,

6
00:50:54.656 --> 00:50:57.347
And I'm grateful today

6
00:50:57.367 --> 00:51:02.250
to some mother for killing her child,

6
00:51:04.541 --> 00:51:06.460
That's all I got.

6
00:51:10.297 --> 00:51:11.840
Stephen, addict.

6
00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.342
Stephen.

6
00:51:13.425 --> 00:51:16.261
Good for y**, man. For y**.

6
00:51:16.553 --> 00:51:19.264
Y** didn't kill anyone. Good for y**.

6
00:51:21.225 --> 00:51:23.685
God checked out on me.

6
00:51:23.769 --> 00:51:26.563
Blacked out in the back seat

6
00:51:27.439 --> 00:51:30.526
I got a body on my grill.

6
00:51:31.652 --> 00:51:34.696
No one knows what I

6
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:36.949
So it's all good, right?

6
00:51:40.613 --> 00:51:42.579
Fuck God.

6
00:51:45.415 --> 00:51:47.668
Fuck God.

6
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:50.087
Fuck all of y**.

6
00:51:53.465 --> 00:51:56.348
Because none of y** got anything I need.

6
00:51:58.178 --> 00:52:01.835
But tell me what I'm supposed to do

6
00:52:06.103 --> 00:52:09.690
I'm gonna be a dad.

6
00:52:12.276 --> 00:52:14.570
Dad to a little baby.

6
00:52:18.323 --> 00:52:20.843
Y** think y**'re a piece of shit?

6
00:52:21.785 --> 00:52:23.996
Y** got no idea, man.

6
00:52:26.415 --> 00:52:28.239
No idea.

6
00:53:39.655 --> 00:53:41.115
What y** looking for, Harjo?

6
00:53:41.135 --> 00:53:42.817
Uh, Holder and Linden.

6
00:53:42.837 --> 00:53:46.175
I got the arrest record and booking

6
00:53:46.195 --> 00:53:48.314
The one that brought the gun to school?

6
00:53:48.334 --> 00:53:50.082
Just leave it. They'll be in soon.

6
00:53:50.102 --> 00:53:52.298
Y** got good hair, kid.

6
00:53:52.318 --> 00:53:55.296
I remember when I had hair like that.

6
00:53:57.589 --> 00:54:00.342
Hair is wasted on the y**ng.
